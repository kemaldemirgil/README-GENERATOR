  # README GENERATOR

  ## 📖Description
  This is a simple README generator created by using the `Inquirer` & `fs` modules. The program runs on `Node.js` and it was created to make life a bit simpler by generating README files without worrying about syntactical problems that might occur.

  ## 🤝Contributing
  This is my first application I've created using `Node.js` and I'm hoping to use it as my first *Open Source* project. Since, I'm still very new to creating *Open Source* projects, I appreciate every contribution and input anyone might have. Pull requests and any other issues are most welcomed, I'm looking to collaborate with creating tests for this application.

  ## 📊Testing
  Unfortunately, as of now, there are no available tests for this application. I'm looking forward to creating some in the future.

  ## ❓Questions
  > Please contact me via Email, I am available anytime to answer any questions there might be.
